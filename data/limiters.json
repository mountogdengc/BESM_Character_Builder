Since Weapon attacks are usually assigned Levels, Enhancements, and Limiters based on their ammunition type, each alternative ammo (which must have a lower Weapon Level than the primary ammunition type) is assigned the Alt-Munition Limiter. Rather than assignments like regular Limiters, tagging a Weapon ammunition type with Alt-Munition instead halves the Weapon Character Point cost. For example, a heavy tank (page 218) uses both sabot and HEAT ammo. Sabot shells are a Level 22 Weapon and HEAT shells are a Level 21 Weapon; consequently HEAT is designated as the Alt-Munition (since the Weapon Level is lower). Normally, a Level 21 Weapon costs 42 Character Points, but the Alt-Munition designation halves the HEAT ammo cost to only 21 Points instead. The Level 22 Weapon sabot still costs the regular 44 Character Points since it is the primary ammunition type.",

If a Weapon such as a crossbow or cannon has plenty of ammunition available but requires time to reload between shots, assign the Activation Limiter instead. One assignment of Ammo means the Weapon can fire 4-6 shots before ammunition runs out; two assignments means 2-3 shots; and three assignments means only 1 shot.

      "description": "Some characters need exposure to a particular substance or energy source in order to regenerate their Health or Energy Points. The speed of this Regeneration depends on the strength of exposure. The substance can be common, such as sunlight or positive emotions, but should not be something that is omnipresent under most practical circumstances (such as breathable air). The GM should rate the strength of exposure to a particular condition or substance using five degrees of intensity, each of which provides a different rate of regeneration: Extremely Weak (1 Point/Level per round), Weak (2 Points/Level per round), Average (3 Points/Level per round), Strong (4 Points/Level per round), or Extremely Strong (5 Points/Level per round). Characters should usually be able to find Average magnitude intensity substances easily. For example, if a character regenerates from sunlight, a sunny day would be sufficient. To continue that particular example, a Strong intensity might be the midday sun at the equator or unfiltered sunlight in space, while an Extremely strong intensity might be sunlight very close to a star (or during daytime on a planet near a star, such as Mercury). Similarly, Weak intensities should be common (indoor light through a window) and extremely weak should be very common (such as any exposure at all to solar radiation). Characters may also find themselves unable to regenerate when the substance is absent (such as at night or when underground). The default assumption is that the substance that triggers the Conditional Regeneration is easy to find (sunlight, noise, heat, an emotion, plants, etc.). If the substance is rare, also take the Environmental Limiter (page 150).",
