Armour Rating does not protect against this. This continues for one round for each assignment of the Continuing Enhancement until the effect is somehow neutralised (GM's discretion; it should depend on the type of attack and may require several rounds for full neutralisation). This type of Continuing effect only applies to the Weapon's damage and not to the special abilities from other Enhancements. Alternatively, Continuing can be defined as an hourly effect which inflicts the same damage as the original attack every hour after the attack, or a daily effect which inflicts the same damage every day. This variation is only ever one assignment and may best represent a disease or a slow poison attack. Unlike a regular Continuing attack, the hourly and daily damage will continue until the victim is dead or makes a successful Difficult (TN 15) Body Stat roll. The check is made with a major obstacle (page 182) on the Stat roll every hour (for hourly effects) or a minor obstacle every day (for daily effects). This type of Continuing attack applies to both damage and the special effects from other Enhancements such as Drain, Enervation, etc. Until the victim is cured of the Continuing attack, they normally cannot heal the damage related to this attack using any method (GM's discretion).",
